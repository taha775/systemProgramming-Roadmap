# systemProgramming-Roadmap


A roadmap to teach myself compiler dev, malware reverse engineering and kernel dev fundamentals. To be noted they are only for the fundamental knowledge and doesn't make you a master of any. I will pick one or more of the below mentioned fields for later research in some specific topics. [Low Level Programming University](https://github.com/gurugio/lowlevelprogramming-university) also has a good list of resources to follow but this is my personal roadmap.

Topics to study here may or may not be in order and can be studied according to your preference, gievn that prerequisites are getting fulfilled for each one of them.

## Prerequisites

I'm already assuming that you have basic understanding of computer architecture and experience with atleast one system programming language, some basics of how assembly works and familiar using any POSIX system. A good detailed look of how computers work at the electronics level can be found in the book [Introduction to Digital Electronics](https://agner.org/digital/digital_electronics_agner_fog.pdf) by Agner Fog. And for the software equivalent work you can refer to [cpu.land](https://cpu.land/).

### System Programming Languages
Learn any two of the given languages, make some basic projects to get yourself familiar with it, solve some programming exercises.
- [C](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/)
- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
- [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/), [C++ reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [C++ (video)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb)

### Learn some Computer Architecture

Learn Arm and RISCV based computer architecture to build an efficient and optimized approach towards solving the problems at hardware level

### Learn some Assembly
Prerequisites: Learn about [Digital Logic](https://agner.org/digital/digital_electronics_agner_fog.pdf)

If you are not familiar with assembly yet, I would recommend checking out some tutorials like-
- [x86 quickstart[MASM]](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html)
- [x86 quickstart [NASM]](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/)

- [Article by 0x41 reversing for dummies](https://0x41.cf/reversing/2021/07/21/reversing-x86-and-c-code-for-beginners.html) to be able to reverse basic crackmes.

After this, I would recommend solving easy crackmes for exercise. [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one) and tryhackme are places to find some of the easy ones. Hard ones still require some pwning knowledge which I'm gona discuss in the exploitation section.

### Compilers

  - Emulation requires knowledge of [VM internals](#vm-internals) and graphics programming.
  - You can use SDL as an IO/graphics/sound engine.
- Try to make a compiled programming language targetting one architecture.
- Learn about the [LLVM toolchain](https://llvm.org/docs/)
- [LLVM tutorial in Rust](https://github.com/jauhien/iron-kaleidoscope)
- Try to follow the llvm tutorial to make your first programming language using llvm backend.
